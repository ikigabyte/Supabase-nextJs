- This project uses Next.js combined with supabase for storing the queries


Notes:
- Changes need to be reflected in real time whenever a user clicks something, and needs to reflect on all users using this program 
- Some actions require an access to a webhook to access other websites and show changes


Realistic Use:

- 5 Users will be on at any one time with about 5-10 changes a minute. About 1000 entries will be in the database at any one time, but no more then 1500.
